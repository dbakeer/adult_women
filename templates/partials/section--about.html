  <p>In a heteronormative and patriarchal-driven society, womanhood is often defined for us and is seldom open to diversity of thought. Adult Women was born out of a conversation between two friends sharing experiences tied to gender, sexuality, and racial identity. We've spent hours on the corners of dance floors sharing stories, deconstructing thoughts, building ideas, and listening to each others wildly different perspectives as women within male-dominated dance communities and professional spaces.</p>
  <p>The more we conversed on these topics, the more we knew we had an idea that felt very special to both of us individually and as friends. It felt empowering. We brought our concept to life in the form of a tangible good we could wear, but what we did not expect was the spark of curiosity and immediate deep connection it would create with and between others. Women from all backgrounds have engaged with us on how they have interpreted this message and what an adult woman means to them.</p>
  <p>Through this community, we strive to continue these dialogues and build meaningful relationships online. We welcome all opinions and perspectives as this is intended to be an inclusive and safe space that exists from iterative learning, growth, and development over time.</p>
